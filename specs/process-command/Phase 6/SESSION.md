# Phase 6 — Session Notes

## Session 1: Spec 6.1.A — Status label on TranscriptionAnimation and execute_action_with_animation helper

### What was accomplished

All 7 tasks in section 6.1.A completed successfully:

1. **6.1.1** — Added `status_label: String` field to `TranscriptionAnimation` struct, initialized to `"Transcribing..."` in `new()`.
2. **6.1.2** — Added `pub fn set_status_label(&mut self, label: &str)` method.
3. **6.1.3** — Added label rendering in `draw()` after the character loop: centered horizontally, 2 lines below `center_y`, gray `Color::Rgb(128, 128, 128)`, guarded by `!is_empty() && label_y < height`.
4. **6.1.4** — Added explicit `animation.set_status_label("Transcribing...");` call in `record.rs::transcribe_recording_with_animation` after animation creation.
5. **6.1.5** — Added `execute_action_with_animation` async function in `process/execute.rs`. Uses a `TerminalGuard` struct with `Drop`-based cleanup (same pattern as `ActionPicker` in `picker.rs`). Sets up its own terminal session, shows animation with "Processing..." label, spawns `execute_action` as a tokio task, polls for cancel input (Esc/q/Ctrl+C), returns `Ok(Some(result))` on success, `Ok(None)` on cancel, `Err` on failure.
6. **6.1.6** — Re-exported `execute_action_with_animation` from `process/mod.rs`.
7. **6.1.7** — All verification passed: `cargo check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test` (58 tests).

### Obstacles encountered

None. All tasks completed on first attempt without issues.

### Out-of-scope observations

- The `execute_action_with_animation` function is not yet called by any command handler — that will happen in section 6.1.B.

## Session 2: Spec 6.1.B — Update all callers to use execute_action_with_animation

### What was accomplished

All 5 tasks in section 6.1.B completed successfully:

1. **6.1.8** — Updated `handle_process` in `src/commands/process.rs`: replaced `process::execute_action(...)` with `process::execute_action_with_animation(...)`. On `None` (cancelled), returns `Ok(())` early. On `Some(result)`, continues with save-to-history and output flow.
2. **6.1.9** — Updated `handle_record` in `src/commands/record.rs`: both processing branches (`Some("")` picker path and `Some(id)` direct path) now use `execute_action_with_animation`. On `None` (cancelled), falls through to output raw transcription text.
3. **6.1.10** — Updated `handle_retry` in `src/commands/retry.rs`: both processing branches now use `execute_action_with_animation`. On `None` (cancelled), falls through to output raw `trimmed_text`.
4. **6.1.11** — Updated `handle_transcribe` in `src/commands/transcribe.rs`: both processing branches now use `execute_action_with_animation`. On `None` (cancelled), falls through to output raw `trimmed_text`.
5. **6.1.12** — All verification passed: `cargo check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test` (58 tests).

Phase 6 is now complete. All tasks in both sections (6.1.A and 6.1.B) are done.

### Obstacles encountered

None. All tasks completed on first attempt without issues.

### Out-of-scope observations

- The cancellation handling in `record.rs`, `retry.rs`, and `transcribe.rs` falls through to output raw transcription text when the user cancels processing. This is intentional per the spec — the user still gets the transcription output even if they cancel the processing step. In `process.rs`, cancellation returns `Ok(())` early since there's no raw text to fall back to (the input was already a saved transcription).
- The `trimmed_text` variable used in the `None` cancel branches of `retry.rs` and `transcribe.rs` requires that the `trimmed_text` binding not be moved before the match — the existing code structure already handles this correctly since `trimmed_text` is `String` (cloned into the match arm that needs it).
